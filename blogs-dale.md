# Blogs

You will submit your six blog posts via Github so the Outcomes team can check them off in GArnet. Blogs are due by 6:00 PM every other Monday. Your week 3 blog may be submitted on Tuesday, since that Monday is off.

To submit, add your link to the table below:

The Capstone blog is due the Monday following the last day of class ()
**Every week (slot) should have a link.**

If you want your readme of blog posts to be added to the repo, rename your `readme.md` to say something like `readme-myname.md`. We will then add it to repository for your classmates to see at the end of the class.
